This is a mobile application for recording patients' details and medical history. The application allows medical staff or carers to create, update, and delete patients' information and medical prescriptions. React Native compiles the application in Visual Studio Code and runs it using XCode and Android Studio simulators.

To log in to the system, run the application in Visual Studio Code and execute the command 'npm start.'

For logging into the application:
- carers: 
  Username: B 
  Password: 1234 
- Managers: 
  Username: M 
  Password: 1234 

The main difference between caregivers and managers is that carers can only view the patients assigned to them, while managers can see all patients in the system and assign them to different carers.

Alternatively, users can create a new account by clicking the register button.

Download the application and save your favorite books before you forget their names.
